#################### BUGS ###################
#1
ship.propetries structure is not correct after save/load
- fix DONE

#2
textureOb, updateAnimationFrame()
current implementation is: one textureOb is shared between many objects, so if the objects has the same texture then animation speed will be rised proportionally, which is not correct. 
- NOT RELEVANT

#3
save/load =>starmap, stars are not shown anymore
- fix DONE

#4 turrels needs update after save/load event
